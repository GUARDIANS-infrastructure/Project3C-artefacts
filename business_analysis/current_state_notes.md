## Friction Points

The following is a summary of the friction points identified in aspects of QIMRB Genome Informatics Groupâ€™s historic data sharing process. 

**From the Genome Informatics SysAdmin**:

* Manual Handling and Multiple Distribution Methods - For very large files, because the requesting researcher may not have credentials for the EGA or dbGap, the Data Access Team must encrypt the data, load onto a hard drive and send the hard drive. Also, depending on the type of file and the capabilities of the requestor, the bioinformatician must decide on a case by case basis the most suitable method of data distribution. This introduces complexity and additional tracking effort.

* Lack of Computational Skills and Need for Education - Where a researcher is sent a hard drive, the bioInformatician regularly is called upon to assist with decryption because the requesting researcher does not have the computational skills. Sometimes the requesting researcher also does not fully understand the requirement for encryption as it applies to their agreement and the bioInformatician provides some informal education on the identifiable nature of the data.

**From the Head of Genome Informatics**:

* Identifiability - The Human Genome Informatics Group often receives fully identified patient donor data from clinical partners, as three forms of patient identification are required to travel with any sample or procedure in clinical settings. The Genome Informatics Group must de-identify the data for research, while maintaining their own secure repository for reidentification when required for clinical reporting or future clinical application of findings.
The risk of re-identification is significant with genomic data. For example, an individual with a rare disease in a specific region is easily re-identifiable if the disease marker appears in their genome. Currently this risk is managed solely at the QIMRB end.
* Security - If a researcher retrieves data from the EGA/dbGap, there is no further visibility of who accesses data, or how data is used, or stored.
